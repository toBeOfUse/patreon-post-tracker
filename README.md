# Patreon Post Activity Tracker

There is no good way to see the most commented-on and liked posts from a creator's Patreon feed (even if you're the creator). This is a simple app that reads public information from the Patreon API and makes it sortable and kind of searchable. It is currently pointed at David Willis and his webcomic "Dumbing of Age."

I originally created this on val.town, but porting it to Cloudflare turned out to be a simple and fun way to try out Workers and Durable Objects. If you want to run it locally, you will have to use Wrangler.
